# Food Recipe Website

This project is a front-end engineer intern assessment test for applying to cmlabs. It is a food recipe website built using Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. The website allows users to search and filter recipes and has a responsive design for both mobile and desktop devices.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

## Features

- Food meals search and filtering.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muhasyraf/cmlabs-frontend-internship-test.git   
   ```
2. Install the dependencies. I recommend using yarn to avoid any dependency issues. If you don't have yarn installed, you can install it with npm install -g yarn. If you prefer not to use yarn, you can use npm with the --legacy-peer-deps flag.

Using yarn:
   ```bash
   cd cmlabs-frontend-internship-test
   yarn add
   ```

Using npm with --legacy-peer-deps:
   ```bash
    cd cmlabs-frontend-internship-test
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

3. Start the local development server:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
   or

    ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
